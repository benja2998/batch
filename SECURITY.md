## Reporting a security issue

If you believe you have found a vulnerability, follow these steps:

- [Create a new vulnerability issue](https://github.com/benja2998/compiler.bat/issues/new?template=vulnerability.yml).
- Fill out the template.
- If you believe this should be kept confidential to you and maintainers, [submit a security advisory instead](https://github.com/benja2998/compiler.bat/security/advisories/new).
- If we don't respond within 24 hours, comment on the issue and mention **@benja2998**.
- You may also submit a vulnerability report to [benja2998@duck.com](mailto:benja2998@duck.com).

*Note that any issues reporting a vulnerability in unsupported versions will be closed and marked as `spam` to keep the issue tracker clean.*
